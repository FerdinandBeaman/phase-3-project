    "In my limited experience with other humans, I have learned that there are some things that have the capacity to tell you more about a them than what you'd think at face value. The amount of bumper stickers on someone's car correlates with being an aggressor on the road ([citation](https://pemco.com/blog/bumper-stickers-linked-to-road-rage#:~:text=They%20observed%20that%20road%20rage,than%20vehicle%20value%20or%20condition.)). Your political party correlates with markers for empathy, or how you might see authority. If you feel emotional about the statement \"the Earth is round\". \n",

    "But, anecdotally, \"Do you believe in god?\" tends to be most interesting. Even if people usually feel strange about the person who is asking them. But what if you could make a reasonable guess about someone's religious beliefs based on everything else they say? You may be able to unlock ways of communicating, persuading, or advertising to that person. For example, it's well known that in The United States a lot of people vote in religious blocks. It could be quite profitable to tell beforehand who someone would go to the booths for if motivated to get off the couch.\n",

    "The World Values Survey asks thousands of people a barrage of questions ranging from their feelings on the news to how afraid they are walking down the street. They describe themselves as \"an international research program devoted to the scientific and academic study of social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the world.\" Thankfully, for our purposes, they also ask the god question.\n",

Before I removed that one question, the logreg models made smarter predictions. Now that the strongest column has been removed... it seems like it doesn't know what to do. Very curious."

    "#### Do I think this model is my best one? Yes.\n",
    "Why? Over the course of the project, I noticed that there weren't models that could find atheists with any consistency. This was also true with all of the redo models I had to make during the surprisingly large amount of time that I spent on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "On earlier iterations, I did find a random forest that was able to reach a recall score for atheists nearing 55%, but that was back when I had a strong religion-associated column still in the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have at least one hypothesis for why the atheists were so difficult to track down: while some religious people tend to coalesce around certain positive/negative stereotypes, plenty of them do not. Those religious people who don't conform to those stereotypes are possibly mostly indistinguishable from atheists, since as a collective both of these groups could make up a hyperdiverse population with few features that bind any of them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to make a guess for atheists that are over 50% accurate is ultimately satisfying. I could easily imagine a business that wants to send out a newsletter or targeted advertising to this minority group, and I would feel happy to recommend my model. Rather than send out ads blindly to 100% of the population in order to reach 20% of it, my model would allow the business to send smarter ads to 20% of the population in order to reach about 10% of it. Much more efficient."
